Description
===========
This README briefly lists the available standard data adapter interfaces of the Smint.io Portals component framework.

Please note, that at any time, using our SDKs, data adapters with custom data adapter interfaces can be implemented. Those custom data adapter interfaces can be called in the same way as the standard data adapter interfaces.

Current version of this document is: 1.0.0 (as of 1st of March, 2024)

- [IAssets](IAssets.md) - Data adapter interface representing a complete feature set needed to read and search assets related data.
- Documentation for further interfaces (e.g. IProductAssets, ICollections, IShares, ...) is coming soon
